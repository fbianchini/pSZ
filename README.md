## Polarized Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Calculator
This repository contains Python code to calculate quantities related to the polarized Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. The polarized SZ effect is a subtle phenomenon in cosmic microwave background (CMB) data analysis, where scattered CMB photons from hot galaxy clusters become partially polarized. 

### Installation
The code can be installed with pip:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pSZ.git
cd pSZ
pip install [-e] .
```
